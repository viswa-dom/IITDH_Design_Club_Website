        Refunds may be provided only in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Duplicate payment.</li>
        <li>Payment deducted but order not received.</li>
        <li>Incorrect/failed transaction.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Refund requests can be submitted at: <strong>your-email@example.com</strong>.

        within 5–7 business days.
      </p>

      <h2>Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        Orders once placed cannot be cancelled, as digital art is delivered
